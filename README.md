Airbnb Price Prediction: An Overview (AB_NYC_2019 Dataset)
The AB_NYC_2019 dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City, including details about prices, locations, and host characteristics. The goal is to predict rental prices based on available features.

Dataset Overview (AB_NYC_2019)
Features include:

Listing details: Name, room type, neighborhood
Location: Borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.), latitude & longitude
Host details: Host ID, number of listings per host
Pricing & availability: Price, number of reviews, availability over the year
Target Variable:

Price (continuous variable) – predicting this is a regression problem
Prediction Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values (e.g., filling missing prices or dropping irrelevant columns)
Converting categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for neighborhood and room type)
Removing outliers (e.g., extremely high or low prices)
Normalizing features (e.g., standardizing numerical values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of prices across different neighborhoods
Correlation between features (e.g., does room type influence price?)
Visualizing trends using heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots
3. Model Selection
Common regression models for price prediction:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Neural Networks (for advanced cases)
4. Model Evaluation
Metrics used for regression problems:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score (to measure variance explained by the model)

Conclusion
Predicting Airbnb prices helps hosts optimize their listings and allows travelers to find affordable stays. By applying machine learning, we can identify key factors that influence pricing and make data-driven recommendations.
